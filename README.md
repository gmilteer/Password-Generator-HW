# Password-Generator-HW
This password generator provides the customer with a strong password to help them protect sensitive data. They can pick a password that includes 8-128 characters (upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, symbols).I used dynamic variables to alert the customer if they choose outside of the 8-128 units. There is a series of questions to add conditions to the password that the customer can answer. I created an alert to let the customer know that they must select one condition in order to generate a password. After the customer goes through all of the conditional questions, I used a for loop to confirm the information and generate a password. Finally, the final result is displayed.
